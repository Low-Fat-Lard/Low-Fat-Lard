## Low Fat Lard
Why does the world have to be toxic? Why does the world have to have so much hate? Well, I believe it's all from anarchic empathy. Here, Low Fat Lard, is a place filled with Oxymorons! To show the world it's true self! To make the world a better place, or something? Glas was really my main thing. I really hope the Irish education system improves in Ireland, because at the mo, it's a huge fat L.
